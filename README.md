# Smart-Sorting-fresh-or-rotten-classifier

## Overview  
Smart Sorting is an innovative project focused on enhancing the precision and efficiency of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. By leveraging the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** deep learning model and adapting it to a specific dataset of fruits and vegetables, this project aims to revolutionize the process of sorting and quality control in the agricultural and food industry.
